    <h2>Design roles</h2>
    <p>
      Before we dive in on what you need to secure your first job in the
      industry, let's look at the roles that exist for designers and how their
      day-to-day looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these won't be definitive introductions to each role, they should
      give you an initial understanding. An excellent way to get a further feel
      for each role is to look at job postings on places like design job boards
      and Linkedin. You can also find designers with those titles and look at
      the types of work they have in their portfolios.
    </p>
    <p>Let's jump right in.</p>

      <template v-slot:content>
        <p>
          A <b>User Experience</b> designer is one that, above all, fights to
          design products that improve people's lives. When a person opens their
          banking app, and it loads faster and is easier to understand at a
          glance, or a person can get a car from the airport in a third of the
          time they were able to before, these are good user experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <b>User Interface</b> designer focuses specifically on improving
          those experiences on screen, in the form of rectangles, circles, and
          more on a screen. They take on the challenge of organizing elements on
          the screen so that people can understand them without thinking.

          Under UX & UI design, there are a variety of fields and skillsets,
          including:

          Frequently when a role mentions either UX or UI design, the
          responsibilities of both are assumed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Controversially, some UX design roles may not require a designer to
          have a developed visual design background.
        </p>
        <h4>Example projects a UX designer might work on:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Designing a new feature, often started by creating a brief in
            collaboration with a project manager
          </li>
          <li>Updating a flow that identified in research as problematic</li>
          <li>
            Conducting user research on an existing product or on conceptual new
            products or features
          </li>
        </ul>

      <template v-slot:title><h3>Visual Design</h3></template>
      <template v-slot:content>
        <p>
          As the name implies, a visual designer focuses on the visual identity
          of a product. A visual designer will own a product's presentation,
          brand, "feel."
        </p>
        <p>
          They are responsible for creating the emotional connection between a
          person and a product and ensuring that teams respect the integrity of
          the visual system through developing and launching features.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pure visual design roles are uncommon in the tech industry (with some
          exceptions, notably
          <a href="https://design.google/jobs/visual-designer/">Google</a>.)
        </p>

            Do I need visual design if I just want to be a UX designer?
          </template>
          <template v-slot:content>
            <p>
              Technically, to be hired at some companies, no. However, in my
              experience, almost universally, more rounded designers create
              vastly better work and succeed more in their roles.
            </p>
            <p>
              When developing your skills, you should try to balance visual
              presentation with user experience, always coming from a place of
              empathy for the people you are designing for.
            </p>

        <h4>Example projects a visual designer might work on:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Launching a new visual identity for your company</li>
          <li>
            Working with systems designers to create or evolve a design system
          </li>
          <li>Partner with a UX designer on a feature or specific interface</li>
          <li>
            Work on additional projects beyond digital ones (visual work for
            events, social media, communication design.)

      <template v-slot:title><h3>UX Research</h3></template>
      <template v-slot:content>
        <p>
          Research is an integral part of every product development cycle. Its
          form will vary based on the size of the company or team and other
          factors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Often at smaller companies and startups, a designer takes on the role
          of user research to obtain essential insights while designing a
          product. If you enjoy this part of the design process the most, you
          might consider becoming a full-time UX researcher. You might even
          consider data science if your interest skews towards qualitative over
          quantitative research.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Note:</b> Some user or UX research roles may require a bachelor's
          or PhD in a relevant field such as computer science, analytics, or
          psychologyâ€“especially at large companies that publish their research
          formally (like Apple, Microsoft, Google, etc.)

      <template v-slot:title><h3>Product Design</h3></template>
      <template v-slot:content>
        <p>
          Product design is a catch-all term used in the industry for a designer
          who covers all roles needed to build a digital product (app, mobile
          app, website.) It combines the functions of UX and visual design with
          an understanding of how to ship a 0-1 product (from idea to launch).

          <template v-slot:title
            ><h4>How are UI, UX, and Product Design different?</h4></template
          >
          <template v-slot:content>
            <p>
              The term Product Design implies a more extensive set of skills
              beyond that of UX design:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>A solid visual design foundation.</li>
              <li>
                An understanding of how products are built (not just designed).
              </li>
              <li>
                A seat at the table when it comes to designing and directing the
                team.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </template>
        </CollapsibleNested>
        <p>
          However, unfortunately, these terms are often used interchangeably in
          job postings and by many people and companies. Be sure to look at the
          responsibilities expected of a role to understand what you will own.
        </p>

          <li>Most projects a UX designer or visual designer might work on</li>

            Identifying a new product opportunity and designing a deck or
            prototype showcasing it in concept.

            culture, team organization, etc.)
