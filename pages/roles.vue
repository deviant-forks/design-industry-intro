    <h2>Design roles</h2>
    <p>
      Before we dive in on what you need to secure your first job in the
      industry, let's look at the roles that exist for designers and how their
      day-to-day looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these won't be definitive introductions to each role, they should
      give you an initial understanding. An excellent way to get a further feel
      for each role is to look at job postings on places like design job boards
      and Linkedin. You can also find designers with those titles and look at
      the types of work they have in their portfolios.
    </p>
    <p>Let's jump right in.</p>

      >
      <template v-slot:content>
        <p>
          A <b>User Experience</b> designer is one that, above all, fights to
          design products that improve people's lives. When a person opens their
          banking app, and it loads faster and is easier to understand at a
          glance, or a person can get a car from the airport in a third of the
          time they were able to before, these are good user experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <b>User Interface</b> designer focuses specifically on improving
          those experiences on screen, in the form of rectangles, circles, and
          more on a screen. They take on the challenge of organizing elements on
          the screen so that people can understand them without thinking.

          Under UX & UI design, there are a variety of fields and skillsets,
          including:

          Frequently when a role mentions either UX or UI design, the
          responsibilities of both are assumed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Controversially, some UX design roles may not require a designer to
          have a developed visual design background.
        </p>
        <h4>Example projects a UX designer might work on:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Designing a new feature, often started by creating a brief in
            collaboration with a project manager
          </li>
          <li>Updating a flow that identified in research as problematic</li>
          <li>
            Conducting user research on an existing product or on conceptual new
            products or features
          </li>

      <template v-slot:title><h3>Visual Design</h3></template>
      <template v-slot:content>
        <p>
          As the name implies, a visual designer focuses on the visual identity
          of a product. A visual designer will own a product's presentation,
          brand, "feel."
        </p>
        <p>
          They are responsible for creating the emotional connection between a
          person and a product and ensuring that teams respect the integrity of
          the visual system through developing and launching features.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pure visual design roles are uncommon in the tech industry (with some
          exceptions, notably
          <a href="https://design.google/jobs/visual-designer/">Google</a>.)

            Do I need visual design if I just want to be a UX designer?
          </template>
          <template v-slot:content>
            <p>
              Technically, to be hired at some companies, no. However, in my
              experience, almost universally, more rounded designers create
              vastly better work and succeed more in their roles.
            </p>
            <p>
              When developing your skills, you should try to balance visual
              presentation with user experience, always coming from a place of
              empathy for the people you are designing for.
            </p>

      <template v-slot:title><h3>UX Research</h3></template>
      <template v-slot:content>
        <p>
          Research is an integral part of every product development cycle. Its
          form will vary based on the size of the company or team and other
          factors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Often at smaller companies and startups, a designer takes on the role
          of user research to obtain essential insights while designing a
          product. If you enjoy this part of the design process the most, you
          might consider becoming a full-time UX researcher. You might even
          consider data science if your interest skews towards qualitative over
          quantitative research.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Note:</b> Some user or UX research roles may require a bachelor's
          or PhD in a relevant field such as computer science, analytics, or
          psychologyâ€“especially at large companies that publish their research
          formally (like Apple, Microsoft, Google, etc.)

      <template v-slot:title><h3>Product Design</h3></template>
      <template v-slot:content>
        <p>
          Product design is a catch-all term used in the industry for a designer
          who covers all roles needed to build a digital product (app, mobile
          app, website.) It combines the functions of UX and visual design with
          an understanding of how to ship a 0-1 product (from idea to launch).

          <template v-slot:title
            ><h4>How are UI, UX, and Product Design different?</h4></template
          >
          <template v-slot:content>
            <p>
              The term Product Design implies a more extensive set of skills
              beyond that of UX design:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>A solid visual design foundation.</li>
              <li>
                An understanding of how products are built (not just designed).
              </li>
              <li>
                A seat at the table when it comes to designing and directing the
                team.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </template>
        </CollapsibleNested>
        <p>
          However, unfortunately, these terms are often used interchangeably in
          job postings and by many people and companies. Be sure to look at the
          responsibilities expected of a role to understand what you will own.
        </p>

        <p>
          Many designers choose to pursue a role in design management after
          leveling their craft for quite a few years. Design Managers should
          enable the success of their designers and fight for their seat at the
          table in all discussions and decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Design managers should expect to be hands-off on actual product work,

          grow.

      <template v-slot:content>
        <p>
          Design Systems, and systems designers, are all the rage right now in
          the design industry. It's tempting to jump feet first into design
          systems, even at the beginning of a project. But there are a few
          things to know about design systems:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b
              >Don't confuse a component library, or style guide, with a design
              system.</b
            >
            You can get the benefit of consistent color, typography & components
            from a simple library of components. Trying to move your product
            into a design system too soon can cut into creativity and add
            unnecessary overhead.
            <a
              href="https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/design-systems-vs-pattern-libraries-vs-style-guides-whats-difference/"
              >Read more</a
            >

            <b
              >Design systems harmonize an array of products across a system.</b
            >
            If you are creating a website with only a few pages or an app with
            only a few primary features, a design system is often overkill. Once
            multiple teams work on different projects in parallel, it might be
            time to consider a system.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b
              >Systems design is one of the most complex roles you can take on
              as a designer.</b
            >
            Even very experienced designers often struggle while launching
            design systems teams. They require high-level fundamentals,
            negotiation with other designers and teams, company backing to
            encourage compliance, and a vast amount of time to consider cases
            and build standards.

          Plan and document new ideas, and help organize a team around building

          encounter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Designers can become great product managers because, initially, these
          roles can seem to be at odds. Time and craft often rub against each
          other but producing a good product takes both. In the product manager
          role, you have the chance to argue from both sides, helping everyone
          on the team understand the value of both high-level execution and
          moving quickly.
