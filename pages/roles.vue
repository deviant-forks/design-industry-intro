    <h2>Design roles</h2>
    <p>
      A good way to get an overview of what different types of designers do in
      their day-to-day is to look at an overview of the roles found in the
      (digial) design industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      While these won't be definitive introductions to each role, a good way to
      get a further feel for each role is to look at job postings for those
      roles on places like design job boards and Linkedin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some larger tech companies have role descriptions seperately from their
      job postings. Reading through these might give some useful clues towards
      what types of roles you might enjoy.

          Product design is an umbrella term used in the industry for a designer
          who covers all, or close to all roles needed to ship a digital product
          (app, mobile app, website.)
        </p>

          We'll discuss further below how this term often used to mean many
          things, and how you can figure out what a posted role is looking for.

        <p>
          As the name implies, a visual designer focuses on the visual
          presentation of a product. A visual designer will own a product's
          presentation,

        <p>
          From the perspective of the tech industry, visual design is an
          uncommon role (with some exceptions, notably
          <a href="https://design.google/jobs/visual-designer/">Google</a>.)
