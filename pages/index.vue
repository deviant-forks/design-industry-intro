    <h1>Intro to the Design Industry</h1>
    <p>
      There is no single path for finding your way in the digital design
      industry. Below I'll outline some common paths, roles and the way they
      interact. However, never feel like you must follow a path anyone lays out
      for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll try to lean less into specific paths you can take and more into
      avoiding common pitfalls and time wasters I commonly see people get stuck
      in (and have been through myself.)
