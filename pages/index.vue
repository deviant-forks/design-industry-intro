      Welcome to the tech industry, <br />
      friends & future coworkers!
    </h2>
    <!-- <div class="editorial p-3 rounded-xl bg-green-50"></div> -->
      <p>
      Hey, I'm Nate ðŸ‘‹ I've been designing apps and websites for the past ten
      years. I'm currently working on developing a fast, collaborative code
      editor called Zed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm excited to talk with you all today. I went to design school here and
      am excited to help designers new to the industry level up.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've tried to include many things I've learned over the years that I wish
      I had known when I started designing. I built this site so you all can
      return to it for reference when you begin the first steps of your design
      journey.
    </p>

      Feel free to jump in with questions any time, and reach out to me over
      email or on twitter if we don't get to something!

    <h2>Finding your path</h2>
    <p>
      There is no "right way" to find your path in the industry. The world of
      digital product design is still rapidly evolving and has come a long way,
      even in the past five years. The exciting part is you are on your way to
      joining an industry with a tremendous amount of impact on people's
      day-to-day livesâ€“It's up to you to make it for better and not for worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together, we'll outline some common paths, roles, and the way they
      interact. However, never feel like you must follow a path anyone lays out
      for you. One of the most magical things about design and the digital world
      is that you can always forge your own way, and there are some exciting
      corners to find.
