    <h2>
      Welcome to the tech industry, <br />
      friends & future coworkers!
    </h2>
    <div class="editorial p-3 rounded-xl bg-blue-50 text-blue-900">
      <p>Hey, I'm Nate ðŸ‘‹</p>
      <p>I've been designing apps and websites for the past ten years.</p>
      <p>
        I'm excited to share this with you all. I excited to help designers new
        to the industry jump in, level up, and hopefully avoid some of the
        pitfalls I did early as a designer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've tried to include many things I've learned over the years that I
        wish I had known when I started designing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I built this site so you all can return to it for reference as you
        begin the first steps of your design journey.

    <h2>Finding your path</h2>
    <p>
      There is no "right way" to find your path in the industry. The world of
      digital product design is still rapidly evolving and has come a long way,
      even in the past five years. The exciting part is you are on your way to
      joining an industry with a tremendous amount of impact on people's
      day-to-day livesâ€“It's up to you to make it for better and not for worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together, we'll outline some common paths, roles, and the way they
      interact. However, never feel like you must follow a path anyone lays out
      for you. One of the most magical things about design and the digital world
      is that you can always forge your own way, and there are some exciting
      corners to find.

        Sections that look like this include opinions that might be more
        personal or less objective. While nothing can be truly objective, I want
        to be transparent about what content is opinionated.
