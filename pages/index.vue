    <h2>
      Welcome to the tech industry, <br />
      friends & future coworkers!
    </h2>
    <p>
      There is no "right way" to find your path in the industry. The world of
      digital product design is still rapidly evolving and has come a long way,
      even in the past five years. The exciting part is you are on your way to
      joining an industry with a tremendous amount of impact on people's
      day-to-day lives–It's up to you to make it for better and not for worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together, we'll outline some common paths, roles, and the way they
      interact. However, never feel like you must follow a path anyone lays out
      for you. One of the most magical things about design and the digital world
      is that you can always forge your own way, and there are some exciting
      corners to find.

    <h2>Finding your path</h2>
    <p>
      Early career designers face a flurry of roles, expectations, and
      technologies they are expected to understand, consider and internalize.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Should I just keep making things? Is there something else I should be
      learning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about learning to code? Write? How about learning 3D? Business?" It
      can seem like there are endless things to learn, and time is limited.
    </p>
    <p>
      While opinions vary, I'll share one possible path while explaining the
      existing roles and where specialization makes sense.

    <p>To get us started, a quote from Julie Zhou:</p>

    <figure class="">
      <div class="quote p-4 rounded-2xl bg-gray-100 text-base italic">
        <div
          class=""

          <p class="mt-0 leading-6">
            In the beginning, just focus on improving your craft and execution
            skills.
          </p>
          <p class="leading-6">
            This means that you should be able to design clear, interactive
            flows that also look visually attractive. My strong opinion here is
            that you need to be good at both interaction design AND visual
            design. If you can only do one, you’re at a disadvantage...
          </p>
          <p class="leading-6">
            If you can get to the point where everything you make looks great
            and makes sense, you will not have trouble landing a design job.
