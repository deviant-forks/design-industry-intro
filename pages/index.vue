    <h1>Intro to the Design Industry</h1>
    <p>
      There is no single path for finding your way in the digital design
      industry. Below I'll outline some common paths, roles and the way they
      interact. However, never feel like you must follow a path anyone lays out
      for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll try to lean less into specific paths you can take and more into
      avoiding common pitfalls and time wasters I commonly see people get stuck
      in (and have been through myself.)

        <p>
          In the beginning, just focus on improving your craft and execution
          skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that you should be able to design clear, interactive flows
          that also look visually attractive. My strong opinion here is that you
          need to be good at both interaction design AND visual design. If you
          can only do one, you’re at a disadvantage...
        </p>
        <p>
          If you can get to the point where everything you make looks great and
          makes sense, you will not have trouble landing a design job.

    <h2>Finding your path</h2>
    <p>
      Early career designers face a flurry of roles, expectations and
      technologies they are expected to understand, consider and internalize.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I continue to learn and practice a variety of different types of
      design? Or do I specialize in one thing like brand design, prototyping?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Should I learn to code? Write? How about learning 3D? Business? There
      seems to be an endless amount of things to learn, and my time is limited."
    </p>
    <p>
      While opinions varry, I'm going to put a path forward while explaining the
      roles that exist, and where specialization makes sense.
