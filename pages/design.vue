    There is no single path for finding your way in the digital design industry.
    Below I'll outline some common paths, roles and the way they interact.
    However, never feel like you must follow a path anyone lays out for you.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'll try to lean less into specific paths you can take and more into
    avoiding common pitfalls and time wasters I commonly see people get stuck in
    (and have been through myself.)
  </p>
  <h2>Design Roles & Paths</h2>
  <p>
    Early in a their career there is an initial fork that many designers reach:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Do I continue to learn and practice a variety of different types of
      design?
    </li>
    <li>Or do I specilize in one thing like brand design, prototyping, etc?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    There are many opinions on this topic, but in my personal experience I would
    guide designers early in their careers to take a general approach to design.
  </p>
  <p>
    Building fundimental skills and crafting high quality work with level up
    your design work at a fast pace.

  <h2>Getting in to the industry</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Learn the basics</li>
    <li>Have work to show</li>
    <li>Have a portfolio</li>
    <li>Be searchable</li>
    <li>Talk about your work</li>
    <li>Understand your level</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>1. Learn the Basics</h2>
  <h3>Design fundimentals</h3>
  <h3>Choose your tools</h3>
  <h3>Should designers _______?</h3>
  <h3>Closing thoughts</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>

        <b
          >You build design your deisgn skills the same way you build muscle.</b

        Without putting in the work it is impossible to get better.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are no shortcuts&mdash;Put in the work consistently and you will
        get better. The designers you look up to have tens of thousands of hours
        of time they have put into their craft.
      </p>
      <p>
        Try recreating apps or websites you like in your design tool. It's ok to
        copy them pixel for pixel, as long as you don't try to claim them as
        your own work. This type of exercise will help you learn how designers
        lay out screens, and help you become faster when working on your own
        projects.
      </p>
    </li>

      <p>
        <b>Don't treat your work as precious.</b> Get feedback early and often,
        and be willing to change your approach and explore alternatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Critical (constructive) feedback is the single most important thing you
        can receive from others to develop your skills. If you feel hesitant
        about asking for feeback about something, that is almost always a sign
        that you should get feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will get better feedback sharing your work throught it's
        development. Here are three useful times to get feedback:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>When you first develop an idea</li>
        <li>
          After you have explored at least 3-4 directions (never share only a
          single direction at this stage!)
        </li>
        <li>Following a deep dive on a promising direction</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If you get feedback at these three points you will most often recieve
        actionable feedback, rather than receving feedback on new directions
        after a project is close to being finished.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best designers I know get feedback early and often from their peers,
        both on a 1:1 basis, and when available, in a formal critique setting.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>Style isn't important to be a good designer.</li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Don't start from design systems when creating your own work. Design
        systems are a way to organize large projects with multiple
        collaborators, and build consistency across many screens.
      </p>
      <p>
        It can be harmful to constrain your exploration early in a project by
        trying to create systems. Design systems are very important, but may not
        build the muscles early career designers need to develop a solid
        foundation.
      </p>

  </ul>
  <h2>Have work to show</h2>
  <h3>Closing thoughts</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>A long writeup doesn't equal better work</li>
    <li>Don't use placeholder content</li>
    <li>Show, don't tell.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Have a portfolio</h2>
  <p>
    Your portfolio doesn't need to be unique or ornate. A portfolio is simply a
    vehicle to share your work. The number one mistake early career designers
    make is spending far too much time creating a portfolio with hardly any work
    in it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Try spending no more than a week on your first portfolio, and check in on
    how you are investing your time by roughly using a 1:4 ratio of time spent
    when building a portfolio to working on projects.
