          There are no shortcuts&mdash;Put in the work consistently and you will
          get better. The designers you look up to have tens of thousands of
          hours of time they have put into their craft.
        </p>
        <p>
          Try recreating apps or websites you like in your design tool. It's ok
          to copy them pixel for pixel, as long as you don't try to claim them
          as your own work. This type of exercise will help you learn how
          designers lay out screens, and help you become faster when working on
          your own projects.

          <b>Don't treat your work as precious.</b> Get feedback early and
          often, and be willing to change your approach and explore
          alternatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Critical (constructive) feedback is the single most important thing
          you can receive from others to develop your skills. If you feel
          hesitant about asking for feeback about something, that is almost
          always a sign that you should get feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will get better feedback sharing your work throught it's
          development. Here are three useful times to get feedback:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>When you first develop an idea</li>
          <li>
            After you have explored at least 3-4 directions (never share only a
            single direction at this stage!)
          </li>
          <li>Following a deep dive on a promising direction</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          If you get feedback at these three points you will most often recieve
          actionable feedback, rather than receving feedback on new directions
          after a project is close to being finished.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best designers I know get feedback early and often from their
          peers, both on a 1:1 basis, and when available, in a formal critique
          setting.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>Style isn't important to be a good designer.</li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Don't start from design systems when creating your own work. Design
          systems are a way to organize large projects with multiple
          collaborators, and build consistency across many screens.
        </p>
        <p>
          It can be harmful to constrain your exploration early in a project by
          trying to create systems. Design systems are very important, but may
          not build the muscles early career designers need to develop a solid
          foundation.
