    <h2>Learn the Basics</h2>
    <h3>Design fundamentals</h3>

    <h3>Choose your tools</h3>
    <h3>Should designers code, write, etc?</h3>
    <p>All of these things are valuable, yet their value is significantly less than strengthening your design craft.</p>
    <p>Don't get lost in a pursuit of every new skill you hear designers tout as important. Focus on establishing one of the above tools each, and invest the rest of your time into producing work and getting feedback.</p>
    <p>You will have years ahead of you to add to your skill set as you work on a range of projects.</p>
    <p><b>One exception of note:</b> If you tend to lean more technical, and enjoy building your own projects, it is worth investing in learning some baseline code skills.</p>
    <p>Pick up some basic html, css and javascript. These foundational skills will teach you a lot about building products, and are stepping stones to a whole world of other tools and languages you can learn.</p>
    <p>Building your ideas in code is a great way to have a variety of portfolio pieces. Some good places to start: Code Academy's <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html">Learn HTML</a> or MDN's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn">Learn web development</a>.</p>

          There are no shortcuts&mdash;Put in the work consistently and you will
          get better. The designers you look up to have tens of thousands of
          hours of time they have put into their craft.
        </p>
        <p>
          Try recreating apps or websites you like in your design tool. It's ok
          to copy them pixel for pixel, as long as you don't try to claim them
          as your own work. This type of exercise will help you learn how
          designers lay out screens, and help you become faster when working on
          your own projects.

          <b>Don't treat your work as precious.</b> Get feedback early and
          often, and be willing to change your approach and explore
          alternatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Critical (constructive) feedback is the single most important thing
          you can receive from others to develop your skills. If you feel
          hesitant about asking for feedback about something, that is almost
          always a sign that you should get feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will get better feedback sharing your work throughout it's
          development. Here are three useful times to get feedback:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>When you first develop an idea</li>
          <li>
            After you have explored at least 3-4 directions (never share only a
            single direction at this stage!)
          </li>
          <li>Following a deep dive on a promising direction</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          If you get feedback at these three points you will most often receive
          actionable feedback, rather than receiving feedback on new directions
          after a project is close to being finished.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best designers I know get feedback early and often from their
          peers, both on a 1:1 basis, and when available, in a formal critique
          setting.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>Style isn't important to be a good designer.</li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Don't start from design systems when creating your own work. Design
          systems are a way to organize large projects with multiple
          collaborators, and build consistency across many screens.
        </p>
        <p>
          It can be harmful to constrain your exploration early in a project by
          trying to create systems. Design systems are very important, but may
          not build the muscles early career designers need to develop a solid
          foundation.
