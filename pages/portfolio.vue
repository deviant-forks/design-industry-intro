    <h2>The Basics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Minimum 3 projects, better to have a generic site with good projects
      </li>
      <li>
        Show organizational skills, collaborative skills and strong design
        foundation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Show the work you want to be hired for (donâ€™t put print work in a
        product design portfolio)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Don't over invest in a portfolio site</h2>
    <p>
      Your portfolio doesn't need to be unique or ornate. A portfolio is simply
      a vehicle to share your work. The number one mistake early career
      designers make is spending far too much time creating a portfolio with
      hardly any work in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Try spending no more than a week on your first portfolio, and check in on
      how you are investing your time by roughly using a 1:4 ratio of time spent
      when building a portfolio to working on projects.
