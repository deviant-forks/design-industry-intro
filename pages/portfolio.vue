    <h2>Have a portfolio</h2>
    <p>
      Your portfolio doesn't need to be unique or ornate. A portfolio is simply
      a vehicle to share your work. The number one mistake early career
      designers make is spending far too much time creating a portfolio with
      hardly any work in it.

      Try spending no more than a week on your first portfolio, and check in on
      how you are investing your time by roughly using a 1:4 ratio of time spent
      when building a portfolio to working on projects.
