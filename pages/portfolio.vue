    <h2>Don't over-invest in your website</h2>
    <p>
      Your portfolio doesn't have to be unique or ornate, as long as it acts as
      an effective vehicle to share your work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The number one mistake designers just coming out of school make is
      spending far too much time creating a portfolio with hardly any work in
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Try spending no more than a week on your first portfolio, and check in on
      how you are investing your time by roughly using a 1:4 ratio of time spent
      building your portfolio to working on projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your portfolio will be with you for a long time, and you will end up
      changing it frequently. It's ok to invest time in a portfolio website but
      only do so once you are <b>sure</b> you have at least three strong
      projects to show.
    </p>

      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Basics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Minimum <b>three</b> projects. Its far better to have a basic site with
        strong projects than a beautiful custom site with a few weak projects.
      </li>
      <li>
        Have <b>one</b> project you can talk about for <b>30 minutes</b>.
        <ul>
          <li>What was the problem?</li>
          <li>How did you arrive at the solution you did?</li>
          <li>What did you do, and who else contributed?</li>
          <li>How much better was the solution?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Showcase your organizational skills, collaboration, and a good design
        foundation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Don't put work in your portfolio that you wouldn't want someone to hire
        you to make. If you want to be a web designer, don't put two print
        design projects in your portfolio.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Getting started</h2>
    <p>
      If you are feeling overwhelmed on where to start, below is a guide to get
      started with the simplest (yet still effective!) portfolio.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Create a <a href="https://read.cv/explore">read.cv</a>. This can act as
        both an initial portfolio and an online resume.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://vanschneider.com/blog/portfolio-tips/write-project-case-studies-portfolio/"
          >Read this</a
        >, then write up the projects you have, up to three.
      </li>
      <li>
        Try to keep each under 750 words (around ~5 minutes of reading.) Have a
        summary of the project right at the top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Each time you finish a project, do a quick write-up while it is fresh in
        your mind. Before long, you will have a ton of work to share when you
        create a complete portfolio site.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><a href="https://read.cv/andy">Andy Chung's</a> cv is a great example to start from.
        <a href="https://read.cv/andy/X2KMqw0jLQhaeavZHPK5">This project</a> is
        around the length you are going for.</p>
